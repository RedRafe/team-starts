### Technical Summary for Development of Separated Starts Multiplayer Mod

#### Overview:
The mod aims to facilitate a balanced multiplayer experience for a high player affluence server by implementing a system of separated starts across multiple copies of the Nauvis planet and additional unique planets. The objective is to minimize early resource competition and player disputes, enhancing cooperative gameplay leading up to a final convergence on the Aquilo planet.

#### Features:

1. **Player Sorting Mechanism:**
   - Upon joining the server, players will be randomly sorted into one of the 9 duplicated Nauvis planets. This ensures that no two teams start in the same location, reducing immediate resource conflict.

2. **Planetary Configuration:**
   - The mod will replicate the Nauvis planet approximately 10 times, resulting in 9 Nauvis instances.
   - In addition to Nauvis, the following planets will be created:
     - **Vcanus:** 3 copies
     - **Fulgora:** 3 copies
     - **Gleba:** 3 copies
     - **Aquilo:** 1 default instance
   - This configuration enables each team to colonize at least one of the additional planets (Vcanus, Fulgora, or Gleba) autonomously while still allowing players the opportunity to interact and support one another.

3. **Resource Distribution:**
   - Each replicated Nauvis and additional planets will be balanced in terms of resource availability to ensure equitable opportunities for all teams.
   - Implement resource caps and spawn adjustments where necessary to mitigate early-game exploitation.

4. **Converging Mechanic:**
   - After an agreed-upon period of team development on separate planets, all players will rendezvous on Aquilo for a designated event or finale. This mechanism will encourage interactions among teams that were previously separated, fostering community-building and strategizing.

5. **Server Management:**
   - Ensure the server can handle the enhanced number of planetary copies and players while maintaining performance and stability.
   - Implement tracking for player progress and resource usage across distinct planets to manage gameplay balance.

6. **User Interface (UI) Enhancements:**
   - Create a clear onboarding process that informs players of their planet assignments and the rules governing the gameplay structure.
   - Develop a communication system that allows teams to coordinate their strategies while separated.

7. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Rigorously test the player sorting mechanism and planet functionalities to ensure correct spawning, resource allocation, and stability.
   - Monitor gameplay for any unanticipated conflicts and adjust parameters as necessary.

#### Conclusion:
This mod will transform the multiplayer experience by allowing teams to independently develop their bases without the immediate threat of resource contention, culminating in a collaborative and engaging finale. Proper implementation of the outlined features will be critical for creating a successful and enjoyable environment for all players.
